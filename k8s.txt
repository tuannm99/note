** add-ons: k8s cannot work independence => we need other opensource for full features k8s cluster 
- cert-manager ==> opensource ssl
- flannel (as mentioned behind) | calico ==> networking
- ingress controller (ingress-nginx, kong-ingress, ...): use for managing ingress
- metallb ==> networking loadbalancer (layer3,4) (for traffic public ip to private ip, we really need it to expose cluster to the internet with Service Type = Loadbalancer)
- storage-class (sc) like openebs => dynamic volumne => auto assign pv to an pvc (no need creating volume, grant access and assign by hands)
- local dns -> service comunication using dns instead of ip

** helm -> package manager for k8s manifest (there are many operation that packaging by helm. We can take advatanges of it for deployment)
